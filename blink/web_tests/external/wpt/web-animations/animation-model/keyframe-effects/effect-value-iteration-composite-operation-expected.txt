This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform: [ scale(1), scale(2) ] animation
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(3, 0, 0, 3, 0, 0) but got matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0): Animated transform(scale) style at 0s of the third iteration expected 3 +/- 0.0001 but got 1
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform: scale(2) animation
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0) but got matrix(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0): Animated transform(scale) style at 0s of the third iteration expected 2 +/- 0.0001 but got 0
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform list animation
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 20, 0) but got matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0): Animated transform list at 0s of the third iteration expected 20 +/- 0.0001 but got 0
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform of matrix function
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(6, 0, 0, 6, 60, 0) but got matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0): Animated transform of matrix function at 0s of the third iteration expected 6 +/- 0.0001 but got 2
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform list animation whose order is mismatched
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(6, 0, 0, 6, 60, 0) but got matrix(2, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0): Animated transform list at 0s of the third iteration expected 6 +/- 0.0001 but got 2
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform list animation whose order is mismatched because of missing functions
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(3, 0, 0, 3, 40, 0) but got matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0): Animated transform list at 0s of the third iteration expected 3 +/- 0.0001 but got 1
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform from none to translate
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 20, 0) but got matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0): Animated transform list at 0s of the third iteration expected 20 +/- 0.0001 but got 0
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform of matrix3d function
  assert_approx_equals: expected matrix3d(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 130, 1) but got matrix3d(1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 30, 1): Animated transform of matrix3d function at 0s of the third iteration expected 130 +/- 0.0001 but got 30
[FAIL] iteration composition of transform of rotate3d function
  assert_equals: dimension of the matrix: Animated transform of rotate3d function at 0s of the third iteration expected 16 but got 6
Harness: the test ran to completion.
