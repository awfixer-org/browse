This is a testharness.js-based test.
[FAIL] HighlightRegistry is a maplike interface that works as expected even if Map.prototype is tampered.
  Failed to construct 'StaticRange': Failed to read the 'endContainer' property from 'StaticRangeInit': Failed to convert value to 'Node'.
Harness: the test ran to completion.
